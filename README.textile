_Ruby, Rails and RHTML snippets for the gedit "Snippets":snippets plugin_

This is a collection of code snippets that I am using in my favorite editor, "gedit":gedit.

h2. Install

The snippets are meant to replace those that come bundled with the Snippets plugin entirely, as some of them use the same keywords and will make a popup-select window appear if you do not remove the default ones.

On a default install, the snippets will be stored in <code>/usr/share/gedit-2/plugins/snippets/ruby.xml</code>, so to remove them, do a

<pre>
sudo rm /usr/share/gedit-2/plugins/snippets/ruby.xml
</pre>

After that, you can either put all the xml files from the <code>snippets/</code> directory in this package into mentioned directory, or store them in your home directory in <code>~/.gnome2/gedit/snippets</code>, which probably is the preferred option.

After putting the files into one of these directories, they should become available automatically when editing .rb files.

h2. Documentation

Have a look into the "cheatsheet":http://github.com/colszowka/gedit-snippets/tree/master/cheatsheet.html

h2. Known Issues

Unfortunately, the Snippets plugin is entirely based upon mime types, so there is no way of making, i.e., ActiveRecord validation snippets only available in Rails models based upon path. 

The effect of this is that you will have all snips defined for Ruby files available in every .rb-file you are editing, even if the inclusion doesn't make sense at all in this particular file. My apologies for that!

I once mailed the author of the plugin, "Jesse van den Kieboom ":http://www.icecrew.nl/~jesse/, about that issue, but unfortunately he does not work on the plugin any more. If anyone is into Python, a path-based snippet enabler patch for the "plugin":snippets would be greatly appreciated!

h2. Style guide

This is a rough list of rules that I use when updating the snips.

h3. 1. Multi-word method or symbol names are abbreviated with the first letter of each word

Examples:
<pre>
validates_presence_of => vpo
:wrong_length => wl
</pre>

h3. 2. Single-word method or symbol names are not abbreviated

h3. 3. For block methods, the original method name is to be used for the {} form, while an appended "o" behind the method name stands for the mulit-line do..end style

Examples:

<pre>
each {|item| puts item} => each
</pre>

<pre>
each do |item|
  ...
end => eacho
</pre>

h3. 4. The description should feature a short form of the included code as well as an optional comment, maybe even from an official RDoc document.
