h1. gedit-snippets

_Ruby, Rails and RHTML snippets for the gedit Snippets plugin_

This is a collection of code snippets that I am using in my favorite editor, "gedit":gedit.

h2. Install

The snippets are meant to replace those that come bundled with the Snippets plugin entirely, as some of them use the same keywords and will make a popup-select window appear if you do not remove the default ones.

On a default install, the snippets will be stored in <code>/usr/share/gedit-2/plugins/snippets/ruby.xml</code>, so to remove them, do a

<pre>
sudo rm /usr/share/gedit-2/plugins/snippets/ruby.xml
</pre>
